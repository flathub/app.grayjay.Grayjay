# Grayjay Desktop Flatpak (unofficial)

This is an attempt to create a flatpak for Grayjay Desktop

## Testing

1. install `flatpak-builder`
2. `flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build-dir app.grayjay.Desktop.yaml`
3. `flatpak run app.grayjay.Desktop` (this is currently the part that doesn't work)
